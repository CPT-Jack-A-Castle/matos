# Remediation

| # | Use case |
|---|---|
| 1 | Publicly accessible EMR Cluster |
| 2 | EMR Account Public Access Block enabled |

Amazon EMR block public access prevents a cluster in a public subnet from launching when any security group associated with the cluster has a rule that allows inbound traffic from IPv4 0.0.0.0/0 or IPv6 ::/0 (public access) on a port, unless the port has been specified as an exception. Port 22 is an exception by default. You can configure exceptions to allow public access on a port or range of ports. Block public access does not take effect in private subnets.
Block public access is enabled for each AWS Region for your AWS account. In other words, each Region has block public access enabled for all clusters created by your account in that Region.
